# RSA-Key-Exchange-MATLAB
I have written a MATLAB code for RSA key exchange algorithm.
The code picks prime numbers P and Q randomly in a specified interval - random numbers range can be modified.
Public key e for message encryption is calculated using prime facotrs of phi(N) - e should be a coprime to phi(N)
private key d for decryption is also calculated - can be seen in the code. I have added comments in the code to better understand what each line of code does.
